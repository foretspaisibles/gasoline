(** Generic message log facilities.

This generic diagnostic facilitiy imitates the classical Unix syslog
service, at the application level.  It uses the same basic
abstractions as [Generic_message] and allows to:
- issue messages to potentially various destinations, according to
  severity and facility.
- use multiple message databanks. *)

Values identifying software facilities should be suitable for the
generic equal and hash functions.  Candidate types like integers and
strings are suitable. *)
