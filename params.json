{"name":"Gasoline","tagline":"Gasoline is an OCaml library providing application templates. Application written with Gasoline are parametrised by the command line, environment or configuration files, they support fine-grained lightweight internationalised diagnostics and handle software component dependencies.","body":"# Gasoline\r\n\r\nThe Gasoline project aims at implementing a Unix-ish application\r\ndevelopment framework for OCaml.  The framework provides application\r\ntemplates factoring application components bootstrapping,\r\nconfiguration analyse and common application patterns, such as\r\n[filter][doc-filter], [secure tool][doc-secure-tool] or\r\n[dæmon][doc-daemon].\r\n\r\nUsers of Gasoline should be enabled to:\r\n\r\n- Rapidly develop applications by using *application patterns* such as\r\n  “Unix filter”, “tabular data processor” or “compiler”.\r\n- Write large software suites whose elements offer homogeneous\r\n  interfaces.\r\n- Use standardised diagnostic facilities supporting\r\n  internationalisation.\r\n- Cleanly distinguish between application components and lower-level\r\n  software engineering artifacts.\r\n- Easily bootstrap and shutdown applications consisting of many\r\n  modules.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Current state\r\n\r\nGasoline is still beta-software, and many features or design elements\r\nare susceptible to change before we reach version 1.0. Current\r\nfeatures are:\r\n\r\n- [Configuration](./doc/Configuration.md) based on files, environment\r\n  variables and command line arguments.\r\n- Configuration cascading rules which can be used to let system\r\n  administrators enforce some settings of installed applications.\r\n- Software [component management](./doc/Component.md)\r\n  which correctly bootstraps and\r\n  shutdowns the application, exception sent by the guest are caught and\r\n  an emergency shutdown procedure is triggered.\r\n- A [diagnostic facility][doc-message] similar to `printf` but better suited to\r\n  internationalisation and having routing rules.\r\n\r\nApplications can take advantage of a\r\n[simplified interface][doc-unicode] to the\r\n[Camomile library][camomile-home] and of writer functions, allowing to\r\nproduce simple SGML or HTML reports.\r\n\r\nSee the [ocamldoc generated documentation][doc-index] of the `master`\r\nbranch for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Free software\r\n\r\nIt is written by Michael Grünewald and is distributed as a free\r\nsoftware: copying it  and redistributing it is\r\nvery much welcome under conditions of the [CeCILL-B][licence-url]\r\nlicence agreement, found in the [COPYING][licence-en] and\r\n[COPYING-FR][licence-fr] files of the distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Setup guide\r\n\r\nIt is easy to install **Gasoline** using **opam** and its *pinning*\r\nfeature.  In a shell visiting the repository, say\r\n\r\n```console\r\n% opam pin add gasoline .\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to install **Gasoline** manually.\r\nThe installation procedure is based on the portable build system\r\n[BSD Owl Scripts][bsdowl-home] written for BSD Make.\r\n\r\n1. Verify that prerequisites are installed:\r\n   - BSD Make\r\n   - [BSD OWl][bsdowl-install]\r\n   - OCaml\r\n   - [broken][broken-home]\r\n   - [camomile][camomile-home]\r\n   - [configuration][configuration-home]\r\n   - [getopts][getopts-home]\r\n   - [lemonade][lemonade-home]\r\n   - [mixture][mixture-home]\r\n   - GNU Autoconf\r\n\r\n2. Get the source, either by cloning the repository or by exploding a\r\n   [distribution tarball](releases).\r\n\r\n3. Optionally run `autoconf` to produce a configuration script. This\r\n   is only required if the script is not already present.\r\n\r\n4. Run `./configure`, you can choose the installation prefix with\r\n   `--prefix`.\r\n\r\n5. Run `make build`.\r\n\r\n6. Optionally run `make test` to test your build.\r\n\r\n7. Finally run `make install`.\r\n\r\nDepending on how **BSD Make** is called on your system, you may need to\r\nreplace `make` by `bsdmake` or `bmake` in steps 5, 6, and 7.\r\nThe **GNU Make** program usually give up the ghost, croaking\r\n`*** missing separator. Stop.` when you mistakingly use it instead of\r\n**BSD Make**.\r\n\r\nStep 7 requires that you can `su -` if you are not already `root`.\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael Grünewald in Bonn, on October 21, 2014\r\n\r\n  [broken-home]:        https://github.com/michipili/broken\r\n  [bsdowl-home]:        https://github.com/michipili/bsdowl\r\n  [bsdowl-install]:     https://github.com/michipili/bsdowl/wiki/Install\r\n  [camomile-home]:      https://github.com/yoriyuki/Camomile\r\n  [configuration-home]: https://github.com/michipili/configuration\r\n  [doc-daemon]:         http://michipili.github.io/gasoline/master/Gasoline_Plain_Daemon.html\r\n  [doc-filter]:         http://michipili.github.io/gasoline/master/Gasoline_Plain_Filter.html\r\n  [doc-index]:          http://michipili.github.io/gasoline/master/index.html\r\n  [doc-message]:        http://michipili.github.io/gasoline/master/Gasoline_Generic_Message.html\r\n  [doc-secure-tool]:    http://michipili.github.io/gasoline/master/Gasoline_Plain_SecureTool.html\r\n  [doc-unicode]:        http://michipili.github.io/gasoline/master/Gasoline_Unicode.html\r\n  [getopts-home]:       https://github.com/michipili/getopts\r\n  [lemonade-home]:      https://github.com/michipili/lemonade\r\n  [licence-en]:         COPYING\r\n  [licence-fr]:         COPYING-FR\r\n  [licence-url]:        http://www.cecill.info/licences/Licence_CeCILL-B_V1-en.html\r\n  [mixture-home]:       https://github.com/michipili/mixture\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
